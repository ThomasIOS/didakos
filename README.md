Didakos
===

**Didakos** is a Learning Management System based on Dokeos. Over the last few years we have incorporated new functions and we have considerably improved those that we already offer. This allows us to offer our clients a unique training experience, with tools that facilitate learning processes and that allow a *comfortable management of complex training plans*. Now we are offering this to any company, institution or individual free of cost.
